The Song of the Midnight Coder

At midnight's calm, when silence grows,
A screen still shines where logic flows.
No bard or knight or scholar proud,
Just keys that clack not far too loud.

A stack of tabs, a worn-out chair,
With coffee brewing midnight air.
A bug appears—a wicked sprite—
But watch! The coder plans to fight.

With lines of code like sharpened blade,
He hacks away, mistakes are made.
Undo, redo, compile, run,
The battle wages 'til it's won.

The semicolons march in place,
A loop escapes its tight embrace.
If logic falters, brace for pain—
But syntax learns to play the game.

The world outside may rest or sleep,
Yet through the code, the dreams run deep.
He crafts the dawn from silent night—
The midnight coder, lost in light.
